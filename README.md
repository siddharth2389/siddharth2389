- 👋 Hi, I’m Siddharth Shekhar
- 👀 I’m interested in product management but I find coding fun. I had first learnt programming in undergrad and liked it but then it fell off on the sidelines. 
But now I spend a lot of my free time learning coding. I am specifically interested in becoming better in Python, SQL and build a basic understanding of full stack programming. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and Javascript. I have uploaded the projects that I worked on during the intro to programming course on udacity. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any fun project where you need a coder. 
- 📫 You can reach me via siddharth2389@gmail.com
